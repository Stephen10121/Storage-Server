# Storage-Server
This is a project I made to try and recreate Google Drive. I felt like it would be cool if I had my own online storage.
This will also probably be an example of what I could do in my resume. Then I realized that this is just an experimental place, so now I am adding a page designated for stocks.

# Requirements
To run this program, you will need to have the latest version of python3 and pip.

To install the required python libraries, type this command in bash:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
